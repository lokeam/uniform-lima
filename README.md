  <summary>‚öôÔ∏è Demo Features Include:</summary>

  **Chunked + Batch Uploads**
  * 5MB chunks via FileReader API for large files (no timeouts)
  * Sequential/parallel processing with granular progress tracking
  * Client-side file splitting to avoid server memory constraints
  * Multi-file drag-and-drop with validation
  
  **DOM Parsing & Selection Mapping**
  - TreeWalker API traverses rendered DOM, filters tooltip nodes while preserving labeled spans
  - Word-index mapping that splits source text and counts words before selection to determine precise start/end indices
  - Normalization layer that handles trailing punctuation and whitespace variations
  - Range preservation using cloneRange() to maintain selection state across async operations
  - Conflict detection with mismatch validation between expected and actual selected text

  **Caching & Persistence**:
  - SessionStorage auto-saves labels on every change (zero data loss on refresh)
  - Export to JSON/CSV/JSONL for NLP training pipelines
